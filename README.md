### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Python developer with experience working on Django projects since 2016. I thrive on tackling big, challenging projects and am always up for a good challenge. In addition to my love for programming, I am also a fan of DevOps and enjoy working with tools like vim, bash, and tmux on a daily basis. :nerd_face: 

Feel free to check out my repositories to see some of my past projects and contributions. If you have any questions or are looking to collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to reach out! ðŸ’»
